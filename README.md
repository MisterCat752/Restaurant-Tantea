# Restaurant-Tantea
As a web developer, I have created a single page website for a food restaurant using HTML and CSS. The website features a clean and modern design that showcases the restaurant's menu, location, and contact information.

The homepage features a full-width header section with a high-quality image of the restaurant's interior or exterior, along with the restaurant's name and logo. The navigation menu is located at the top of the page, with links to different sections of the site.
